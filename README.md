🌟 Personal Finance Analysis Project: Turning Data into Insights 🌟

I’m excited to share a personal guided finance project 📈 I recently completed using dummy financial data from 📆 January 2021 to January 2024📆 provided by Codebasics Team.

P𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 Outline:
In this project, I explored and analysed 📊 my spending, investments, expenses, and savings, 🗂️ and uncover meaningful trends and insights. 🔎 

📊 Key Highlights of the Project:
✅ Visualized income, expenses, savings, and net worth using Power BI
✅ Leveraged DAX formulas to calculate values and enhance data analysis
✅ Analysed spending patterns: how I spend, where I spend, and how I save
✅ Answered a critical question: "Do I spend/save according to what I earn?" through a detailed visual chart
✅ Tracked saving, investing, and net worth trends on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis
